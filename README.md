# **Unlocking Healthcare Efficiency Patterns**
## **Patients, Costs, and Outcomes**

## **Overview**
- The National Healthcare Oversight Organization is carrying out an audit of hospitals across the United States.  
- This analysis examines a dataset of 55,500 unique patient records from 10 major hospitals across the U.S. The dataset contains information about hospital admissions, medical conditions, medications, insurance providers, and treatment costs, offering a comprehensive view of the healthcare ecosystem.

- ## **Problem Statement**
- Healthcare organizations face challenges in optimizing patient care while managing costs. 
- Without data-driven insights, hospitals may struggle with resource allocation, treatment standardization, and identifying patterns in patient demographics and outcomes. 
- This analysis addresses these challenges by extracting meaningful patterns from hospital data.

- ## **Business Objectives**
1. **General Objective**
- To leverage data analytics for improving healthcare decision-making, optimizing costs, and enhancing patient outcomes

2. **Specific Objectives**
- Identify demographic patterns in hospital admissions
- Analyze prevalence and treatment patterns of medical conditions
- Evaluate hospital performance metrics including length of stay and treatment costs
- Assess medication prescription patterns across conditions and hospitals
- Examine the impact of admission types on patient outcomes and costs
- Analyze insurance provider coverage and cost implications
- Identify geographic patterns in healthcare delivery
